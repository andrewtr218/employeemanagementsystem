# employeemanagementsystem
This Employee Management System allows users to input departments, roles, and employees. Some polish is required in consolidating the missing or asynchronous aspects of the project. Add and View functions work.

## Basic Flow
The schema.sql and seed.sql files are used to initiliaze the tables and database in MySQL. Server.js directs the command line loop to run until all the information the user wishes to enter has been entered. Package.kson and Package-lock.json contain the npm packages used: specifcally MySQL and inquirer.

## TODO
Add functionality to assign roles to employees manually.
